# Hello-World
The first repository created by this Intense (but lovable) user.
This user, who had been using computers since the user interface consisted of handing a deck of 80 column cards to a person behind a desk (and whose father worked for IBM repairing keypunches at the census in Baltimore), has finally embraced the open-source world and has created a Git-Hub repository.
